## Moon shoot

My hopes are that people can agree on how most applications should work, and functionality that certain parts need to be considered complete. We have turing complete, we need something to describe the functionality and features in the same way.

## Examples

The one example of this I can quickly jot down now is the following.

I was working in my paperwork on instance, and frustrated with how current application is set up, that I can't have two tabs open.
The question arises, should I create a new chrome tab ? Even by doing that, I would not be happy, the screen real-estate is just not optimal enough. So yes, I would like a tab setup in the application, maybe another guy does not, but I'm sure people would appreciate it, then I thought, shouldn't it be something standard our programming models should accomodate ? And thinking of this, my answer would be yes.

This is more in line with something else, but is related to rdio service shutting down.

Preferably, transferring to another service should not result in us losing access to such a clean ui, you should be able to use w/e UI you want to use.
